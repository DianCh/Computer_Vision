1. In this zip file I’ve included the TPS implementation “morph_tps.m” and the resulting video “Project2_eval_tps_four.mov”. Everything else is the same as the submitted required part.

2. The pixel value retrieval uses “interp2” function in Matlab which get 0 value for points outside the range, so there are some black wiggles around the border of the video.
